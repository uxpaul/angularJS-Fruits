# [AngularJs - Data binding](https://github.com/uxpaul/angularJS-Fruits)

Data binding with AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.
In this little project I fully use the core of AngularJs.
Which is to say, passing data from a controller to another.
< DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself ) by using things ever done on an another controller.>
